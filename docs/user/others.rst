Introduction
------------

To report data other than Article 7 and RAF (Accounting for essential and critical uses), choose the corresponding obligation from the list (see :ref:`List of reporting obligations`), fill-in the :guilabel:`Submission Information` tab and upload the supporting documentation in the :guilabel:`Files` tab, as explained in the general :ref:`Data entry forms` chapter, then :guilabel:`Save` and :guilabel:`Submit`.

You don't have to enter structured data in these forms. The secretariat will process the data reported (as uploaded files) and, once finished, you will be able to view the processed results in the additional tabs, as described below.
