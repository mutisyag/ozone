		<h1>Introduction</h1>

		<p>1. The attached data forms have been designed to make reporting easier for the parties. The reporting is prescribed by Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol and further described in various decisions of the Meeting of the Parties. Some decisions introduce additional items that parties may report voluntarily.
		</p>

		<p>2. The data reported in accordance with the data forms will be used to determine the calculated levels of production and consumption, upon which the control measures are based.
		</p>

		<p>3.The major features of the forms are as follows:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Six separate data forms are provided for imports, exports, production, destruction, trade with non-parties and emissions of controlled substances. Please use only those data forms applicable to your country and ignore the other forms, after ticking off the respective “No” box in the questionnaire. For example, many parties only import and do not export, produce, destroy or trade with non-parties in any of the substances. If this is the case, please use only data form 1 on imports and ignore the other forms, after ticking off the “No” boxes for questions 1.2 – 1.6 on the questionnaire.
				</li>

				<li>A row has been provided in data forms 1 (imports) and 3 (production) for each of the substances in Annex A, Annex B Groups II and III, Annex E and Annex F. However, for categories of “Other CFCs” (Annex B Group I) and HCFCs (Annex C Group I), the form is made shorter by providing rows only for substances commonly reported by parties in the past. A few blank rows are provided for more substances, if needed. HBFCs and BCM (Annex C Groups II and III) were phased out by all parties immediately upon inclusion in the list of controlled substance; hence, one blank row has been provided for them as a formality only. You may use the computerized forms supplied by the Secretariat or paper forms. Parties who use the computerized forms can easily add more rows as needed; parties using paper forms are free to add pages as required.
				</li>

				<li>The following are some of the different categories of uses of controlled substances that need to be reported:
					<ul>
						<li>Feedstock uses for all substances</li>
						<li>Essential uses, including laboratory and analytical uses, for substances as approved by the Meeting of the Parties from time to time</li>
						<li>Quarantine and pre-shipment applications for methyl bromide</li>
						<li>Process agent uses for specific applications as approved in table A of decision X/14 and updated periodically by the Meeting of the Parties</li>
						<li>Critical or emergency uses of methyl bromide as approved from time to time</li>
						<li>Exemption for high-ambient-temperature parties</li>
						<li>It is necessary for each party to specify how much of its production, export or import is used for these categories. Where applicable, the Secretariat will deduct these quantities from the total figures. Provision is made in the data forms for these categories. For exempted essential, critical, high-ambient-temperature or other uses, provision has also been made for parties to specify the decision of the Meeting of the Parties that approved the use.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>The same forms can be used for reporting for baseline years and other years. It should be noted that paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol both provide that the parties may submit the best possible estimates of data for the base years if actual data are not available.</li>

				<li>The basis for reporting requirements and definitions are given in sections 2 and 4 below respectively.</li>
				
				<li>A “remarks” column has been provided at the end of each row, and a “comments” box has been provided at the end of each form, for parties to include any additional information that they believe would assist the Secretariat in processing their data report.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<h1>General instructions</h1>

		<p>1. Parties are requested to report the production and consumption of bulk controlled substances in tonnes, <strong>without</strong> multiplying by the relevant ozone-depleting-potential or global-warming-potential values.
		</p>

		<p>2. In order to avoid duplication, quantities contained in manufactured products should not be included in a country's consumption, regardless of whether the end-products are imported or exported.
		</p>

		<p>3. It is crucial that data be provided separately for each individual controlled substance listed in the forms. Further, as requested in decisions XXIV/14 and XXIX/18, parties should enter a number in each cell in the data reporting forms that they submit, including zero, where appropriate, rather than leaving any cells blank. This provision does not apply to optional or voluntary data in the reporting forms.
		</p>

		<p>4. When calculating production, the Montreal Protocol allows countries to deduct amounts of controlled substances destroyed and amounts used for feedstock and for quarantine and pre-shipment applications. However, when reporting production data, parties <strong>should not deduct</strong> these figures from their data. The Secretariat will make the necessary deductions.
		</p>

		<p>5. Parties with approved essential-use exemptions should report to the Secretariat on the amounts of controlled substances produced or consumed for those uses using the accounting form approved by decision VIII/9, paragraph 9.
		</p>

		<p>6. Parties with approved critical-use exemptions should report to the Secretariat on the amounts of methyl bromide produced or consumed for those uses using the form approved by decision Ex.I/4, paragraph 9 (f) and decision Ex.II/1, paragraph 3.
		</p>

		<p>7. Parties might import or export mixtures containing controlled substances, in particular Annex F substances, rather than its constituent controlled substances. If this is the case, the parties may choose to report the quantity of the mixture in the designated section on the form. If you choose to report mixtures, please take care to ensure that the quantities reported are those of the mixtures, not their individual constituents. The Secretariat will calculate the quantity of each pure substance from the mixtures and will include the appropriate quantities of those pure substances in the reported data. An illustrative list of mixtures containing controlled substances with their compositions is given in section 11 of these data reporting instructions and guidelines. If the mixture being reported is not included in section 11, please indicate the percentage by weight of each constituent controlled substance of the mixture being reported. For further information about the composition and commercial trade names of chemical products containing controlled substances, visit the “Trade names of chemicals containing ozone-depleting substances and their alternatives” page of the OzonAction website.1 This worldwide database service is designed to help customs officials and national ozone units control imports and exports of controlled substances and prevent their illegal trade.
		</p>

		<p>8. Parties listed in Appendix II to decision XXVIII/2 that produce or consume controlled substances under the high-ambient-temperature exemption should also report separately production and consumption data to the Secretariat for the subsectors to which the exemption applies (decision XXVIII/2, paragraph 30). Subsector-specific information should be provided by the country using the exemption, not by the producer country. Production under the high-ambient-temperature exemption should only be reported if the production is for use internally by the producing country, not for export.
		</p>

		<h1>Definitions</h1>

		<p>1. “Consumption” means production plus imports minus exports of controlled substances (Montreal Protocol, Article 1).</p>

		<p>2. “Controlled substance” means a substance in Annex A, Annex B, Annex C, Annex E or Annex F to the Protocol, whether existing alone or in a mixture. It includes the isomers of any such substance except as specified in the relevant annex, but excludes any controlled substance or mixture that is in a manufactured product other than a container used for the transportation or storage of that substance (Montreal Protocol, Article 1).
		</p>

		<p>3. “Destruction process” is one that, when applied to controlled substances, results in the permanent transformation or decomposition of all or a significant portion of such substances (decisions I/12F, IV/11, V/26 and VII/35).
		</p>

		<p>4. “Production” means the amount of controlled substances produced, minus the amount destroyed by technologies approved by the parties and minus the amount entirely used as feedstock in the manufacture of other chemicals. The data forms prescribe reporting of feedstock use and of quantities destroyed separately, and reporting of total production <strong>without</strong> deduction. The Secretariat will make the necessary deduction.
		</p>

		<p>5. Amounts recovered, reclaimed or recycled (or reused) are not to be considered as “production” (Montreal Protocol, Article 1), even though they are to be reported (Article 7 of the Protocol).
		
			“Recovery, recycling and reclamation” have been defined by the parties (decision IV/24) as follows:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					Recovery: The collection and storage of controlled substances from machinery, equipment, containment vessels, etc., during servicing or prior to disposal;
				</li>
				<li>
						Recycling: The reuse of a recovered controlled substance following a basic cleaning process such as filtering and drying. For refrigerants, recycling normally involves recharge back into equipment. It often occurs “on-site”;
				</li>
				<li>
					Reclamation: The re-processing and upgrading of a recovered controlled substance through such mechanisms as filtering, drying, distillation and chemical treatment in order to restore the substance to a specified standard of performance. It often involves processing “off-site” at a central facility.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p>6. “Quarantine and pre-shipment applications” have been defined by the parties (decision VII/5) as follows:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>“Quarantine applications”, with respect to methyl bromide, are treatments to prevent the introduction, establishment and/or spread of quarantine pests (including diseases), or to ensure their official control, where:
					<ul>
						<li>Official control is that performed by, or authorized by, a national plant, animal or environmental protection or health authority;</li>
						<li>Quarantine pests are pests of potential importance to the areas endangered thereby and not yet present there, or present but not widely distributed and being officially controlled.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>“Pre-shipment applications” are those treatments applied directly preceding and in relation to export, to meet the phytosanitary or sanitary requirements of the importing country or existing phytosanitary or sanitary requirements of the exporting country.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p>7. The Eleventh Meeting of the Parties decided in decision XI/12 that pre-shipment applications are those non-quarantine applications applied within 21 days prior to export to meet the official requirements of the importing country or existing official requirements of the exporting country. Official requirements are those that are performed by, or authorized by, a national plant, animal, environmental, health or stored product authority.
		</p>

		<p>8. On transhipment and re-export of substances, the Fourth Meeting of the Parties decided (decision IV/14):
			<br>
			<blockquote>“To clarify Article 7 of the amended Protocol so that it is understood to mean that, in cases of tran(s)shipment of controlled substances through a third country (as opposed to imports and subsequent re-exports), the country of origin of the controlled substances shall be regarded as the exporter and the country of final destination shall be regarded as the importer. In such cases, the responsibility for reporting data shall lie with the country of origin as the exporter and the country of final destination as the importer. Cases of import and re-export should be treated as two separate transactions; the country of origin would report shipment to the country of intermediate destination, which would subsequently report the import from the country of origin and export to the country of final destination, while the country of final destination would report the import.”
			</blockquote>
		</p>

		<p>9. With respect to trade in bulk methyl bromide, the Eighth Meeting of the Parties decided (decision VIII/14):
			<br>
			<blockquote>“To clarify decision I/12A of the First Meeting of the Parties as follows: trade and supply of methyl bromide in cylinders or any other container will be regarded as trade in bulk in methyl bromide.”</blockquote>
		</p>

		<p>10. “Regional economic integration organization” means an organization constituted by sovereign States of a given region that has competence in respect of matters governed by the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer or its protocols and has been duly authorized, in accordance with its internal procedures, to sign, ratify, accept, approve or accede to the instruments concerned. The only such organization for the purpose of the Montreal Protocol is the European Union.
		</p>

		<p>12. The Montreal Protocol stipulates, under paragraph 8 (a) of Article 2, that any parties which are member States of a regional economic integration organization as defined above may agree that they shall jointly fulfil their obligations respecting consumption provided that their total combined calculated level of consumption under Articles 2A to 2J of the Protocol does not exceed the levels required by those articles.
