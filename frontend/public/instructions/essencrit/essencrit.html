		<h2>Essential Uses Other than Laboratory and Analytical Applications</h2>
		<p>Note that an essential use for particular year may be the sum of quantities authorised by Decision in more than one year.</p>
		<p>If a transfer between Parties of an essential use has been made for the year, then the Parties should report the quantity transferred to or from another Party and identify the other Party involved in the transfer.</p>
		<p>Where possible, national governments should include quantities on hand as of 1 January 1996 for non-Article 5 Parties or as of 1 January 2010 for Article 5 Parties. National governments not able to estimate quantities on hand as of 1 January 1996 or 1 January 2010 respectively can track the subsequent inventory of ODS produced for essential uses (Column M) - carried forward as "On Hand at Start of Year" for next year.</p>

		<h2>Critical uses of methyl bromide</h2>
		<p>Note that critical use for particular year may be the sum of quantities authorised by decision in more than one year.</p>
		<p>National governments nominating critical uses should include quantities on hand as of 1 January 2005. National governments not able to estimate quantities on hand as of 1 January 2005 can track the subsequent inventory of methyl bromide produced for critical uses (Column L) - carried forward as "On Hand at Start of Year" for next year.</p>
